                : Cookies; Usage data; first name; surname; e-mail.<br>
                <br>
                Complete details on each type of data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy
                policy or through specific information texts displayed before the data is collected.<br>
                Personal Data may be freely provided by the User or, in the case of Usage Data, collected automatically
                when using this Application.<br>
                Unless otherwise specified, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory. If the User refuses to
                communicate them, it may be impossible for this Application to provide the Service. In cases where this
                Application indicates some Data as optional, Users are free to refrain from communicating such Data,
                without this having any consequence on the availability of the Service or its operation.<br>
                Users who have doubts about which Data is mandatory are encouraged to contact the Owner.<br>
                Any use of Cookies - or other tracking tools - by this Application or by the owners of third-party
                services used by this Application, unless otherwise specified, has the purpose of providing the Service
                requested by the User, in addition to further purposes described in this document and in the Cookie

                The User assumes responsibility for the Personal Data of third parties obtained, published or shared
                through this Application and guarantees that he or she has the right to communicate or disseminate them,
                freeing the Owner from any liability towards third parties.<br>
                <br>
                Method and place of processing of collected data.<br>
                Processing methods<br>
                The Data Controller adopts appropriate security measures aimed at preventing unauthorized access,
                disclosure, modification or destruction of Personal Data.<br>
                The processing is carried out using IT and/or telematic tools, with organizational methods and with
                logic strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, other parties
                involved in the organization of this Application (administrative, commercial, marketing, legal, system
                administrators) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, postal couriers,
                hosting providers, IT companies, communication agencies) also appointed, if necessary, as Data
                Processors by the Data Controller. The updated list of Managers can always be requested from the Data
                Controller.<br>
                <br>
                Legal basis of the processing<br>
                The Owner processes Personal Data relating to the User if one of the following conditions exists:<br>
                <br>
                the User has given consent for one or more specific purposes; Note: in some jurisdictions the Owner may
                be authorized to process Personal Data without the User's consent or another of the legal bases
                specified below, until the User objects ("opt-out") to this treatment. However, this is not applicable
                if the processing of Personal Data is regulated by European legislation on the protection of Personal
                Data;<br>
                the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract with the User and/or the execution of
                pre-contractual measures;<br>
                the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject;<br>
                the processing is necessary for the execution of a task of public interest or for the exercise of public
                powers vested in the Data Controller;<br>
                the processing is necessary for the pursuit of the legitimate interest of the Data Controller or third
                parties.<br>
                However, it is always possible to request the Data Controller to clarify the concrete legal basis of
                each processing and in particular to specify whether the processing is based on the law, provided for by
                a contract or necessary to conclude a contract.<br>
                <br>
                Place<br>
                The Data is processed at the Owner's operational offices and in any other place where the parties
                involved in the processing are located. For further information, contact the Owner.<br>
                The User's Personal Data may be transferred to a country other than the one in which the User is
                located. To obtain further information on the place of processing, the User can refer to the section
                relating to details on the processing of Personal Data.<br>
                <br>
                The User has the right to obtain information regarding the legal basis of the transfer of Data outside
                the European Union or to an international organization governed by public international law or
                constituted by two or more countries, such as for example the UN, as well as regarding the security
                measures adopted by the Data Controller to protect the Data.<br>
                <br>
                The User can verify whether one of the transfers just described takes place by examining the section of
                this document relating to details on the processing of Personal Data or request information from the
                Data Controller by contacting him at the details indicated at the beginning.<br>
                <br>
                Retention period<br>
                The Data is processed and stored for the time required by the purposes for which it was collected.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore:<br>
                <br>
                Personal Data collected for purposes related to the execution of a contract between the Owner and the
                User will be retained until the execution of this contract is completed.<br>
                Personal Data collected for purposes attributable to the legitimate interest of the Owner will be
                retained until such interest is satisfied. The User can obtain further information regarding the
                legitimate interest pursued by the Owner in the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                Owner.<br>
                When the processing is based on the User's consent, the Owner may retain the Personal Data for longer
                until such consent is revoked. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a
                longer period in compliance with a legal obligation or by order of an authority.<br>
                <br>
                At the end of the retention period, the Personal Data will be deleted. Therefore, upon expiry of this
                deadline the right of access, cancellation, rectification and the right to data portability can no
                longer be exercised.<br>
                <br>
